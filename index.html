                    <h32> I can write the saddest poem of all tonight.</h32>

                    <h33> Write, for instance: </h33>

                    <h60> "The night is full of stars,
                        and the stars, blue, shiver in the distance."</h60>

                    <h34> The night wind whirls in the sky and sings.</h34>

                    <h35> I can write the saddest poem of all tonight.</h35>

                    <h61> I loved her, and sometimes she loved me too.</h61>

                    <h36> On nights like this, I held her in my arms.</h36>

                    <h62> I kissed her so many times under the infinite sky.</h62>

                    <h37> She loved me, sometimes I loved her.</h37>

                    <h63> How could I not have loved her large, still eyes?</h63>

                    <h38> I can write the saddest poem of all tonight.</h38>

                    <h64> To think I don't have her. To feel that I've lost her.</h64>


                    <h39> To hear the immense night, more immense without her.
                        And the poem falls to the soul as dew to grass.</h39>

                    <h40> What does it matter that my love couldn't keep her.
                        The night is full of stars and she is not with me.</h40>

                    <h41> That's all. Far away, someone sings. Far away.
                        My soul is lost without her.</h41>

                    <h42> As if to bring her near, my eyes search for her.
                        My heart searches for her and she is not with me.</h42>

                    <h43> The same night that whitens the same trees.
                        We, we who were, we are the same no longer.</h43>

                    <h44> I no longer love her, true, but how much I loved her.
                        My voice searched the wind to touch her ear.</h44>

                    <h45> Someone else's. She will be someone else's. As she once
                        belonged to my kisses.
                        Her voice, her light body. Her infinite eyes.</h45>

                    <h46> I no longer love her, true, but perhaps I love her.
                        Love is so short and oblivion so long.</h46>

                    <h47> Because on nights like this I held her in my arms,
                        my soul is lost without her.</h47>

                    <h48> Although this may be the last pain she causes me,
                        and this may be the last poem I write for her.</h48>
